### Cross-Platform Support
Even though I will probably add full cross-platform support in the future, clink is mainly developed for windows users and based on the Windows commandline for system operations.
There are still many features that dont rely on operating system specific operations and are purely executed using python. This means
that if you can live without some functions, feel free to port this project to Mac and Linux Systems.
<br>
If you have any questions or ideas on improving cross-platform development, please tell me in the [Issues](https://github.com/schmalzl/clink/issues) Tab of Github
using the **enhancement** label.

### Gallery
*This project is still in active development so gallery pictures will be coming soon.*

### Support & FAQ

<br> See [docs.md](./docs/docs.md) for a detailed feature documentation and starting guide.

For further support, feel free to open a new Topic in the [Issues](https://github.com/schmalzl/clink/issues) section of Github.
