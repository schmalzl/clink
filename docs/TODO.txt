- Disable maximizing viewport completly or track fullscreen to resize internal windows
- Set Actions menu to always primary or disable header bars
- Change line distance in console (should be narrower together)
    --> Change UI Style
        --> Apply narrow styles to windows and only narrower text styles to viewport menu bar as a go around to resizing.
- important: make the console update everytime a new item gets appended
    - deps installer: print result.stdout to internal console instead of terminal
- cleanup: comment everything better & restructure project for more clarity
- add changes to github
- get the current project display to work
