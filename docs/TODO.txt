ISSUES & TODO LIST

### THIS LIST IS NOT WELL MAINTAINED AND MAY BE OUT OF DATE ###
TODO.txt is basically just a place for my personal notes.
Feel free to open up a new issue on GitHub if you have any questions.

- console: change ui styling of imgui. Lines should be closer together.
- console: make the console update everytime a new item gets appended
- console: make the stdout from the dependency installer write the output to the internal console

- viewport: Disable maximizing viewport completly or track fullscreen to resize internal windows
- viewport: get the current project display to work (menu bar)

- style: change ui colors to a darker theme and disable different colors for top bars of windows.

- cleanup: comment everything better & restructure project for more clarity
